##  Now for the development, I used:
* Kotlin (I didn't use Jetpack Compose tho because it wasn't specified. Just normal XML)
* Retrofit for Api call
* Jetpack datastore to store the selected brand who's products to display
* Androidx navigation for navigating between the fragments and I passed a bundle for the specific product to display
* Swipe to refresh layout in the first fragment
* Glide to load the product image
* Timber for logging
* A workflow file to run an automated build on github
* MVVM
* Dagger - Hilt for dependency injection
* Kotlin Coroutines
* Kotlin Flow
* ViewBinding to bind the UI
* Jetpack Lifecycle
